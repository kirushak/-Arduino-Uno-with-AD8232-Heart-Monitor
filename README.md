ECG is a type of time-series data, it has its own particular properties.
This project is created to learn these specifics and how to obtain valuable features from the ECG signal.

The AD8232 is a neat little chip used to measure the electrical activity of the heart. This electrical activity can be charted as an ECG or Electrocardiogram. [Electrocardiography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography) is used to help diagnose various heart conditions. [The datasheet can be found here.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Biometric/AD8232.pdf)
